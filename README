Package queue implements a few types of queues. Notably an asynchronous queue
for non-blocking data processing and a SQLite3 queue.

Package httpq is a specialization of the async queue for HTTP requests. It also
demonstrates handling ErrEmpty in an async queue through conditional variables
rather than busy waiting.
